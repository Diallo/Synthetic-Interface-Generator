# Description
This description contains the tests conducted using `experiments.py`.

### Experiment 1 - Single modification equal inputs/outputs
The first experiment focuses on identifying time taken per single modification of `create, delete, merge, split` this is done using an equal number of inputs and outputs as taken from the set of `[10,30,50,80]`. 



### Experiment 2 - Single modification varying inputs/outputs
The second experiment focuses on identifying time taken per single modification of `create, delete, merge, split` this is done using an varying number of inputs and outputs as taken from the set of `[10,30,50]`. 

### Experiment 3 - Multiple equal modification (3) equal inputs/outputs
The third experiment focuses on identifying time taken per multiple modification of `create, delete, merge, split` this is done using an varying number of inputs and outputs as taken from the set of `[10,30,50,80]`. 


### Experiment 4 - Multiple equal modification (5) equal inputs/outputs
The second experiment focuses on identifying time taken per multiple modification of `create, delete, merge, split` this is done using an varying number of inputs and outputs as taken from the set of `[10,30,50,80,100]`.
